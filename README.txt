TREEBANK DESCRIPTION
====================

The original treebank is HPSG-based. It consists of 215 000 tokens 
(over 15 000 sentences).
It consists of two parts: core set, which is a test suite for Bulgarian,
consisting of 1500 sentences, extracted from Bulgarian grammars; remaining
set, which comprizes isolated random sentences and running texts from
Bulgarian newspapers, literature and administrative documents.
All the texts were processed automatically at tokenization, morphological
and chunk level. Then, the full syntactic analysis were perfomed manually by
trained annotators.

The BTB-UD contains in its third release 11 138 sentences which exclude
ellipses and some rare phenomena.
The conversion was done semi-automatically, with the application of set of
rules and constraints for result consistency.

In the third release we did not add new sentences. We have improved the annotation through checking and correcting the following relations:
- appositions (the wrongly annotated vocatives and appositions were corrected as nmod)
- xcomp (the ccomp relations were checked for control structures and re-annotated as xcomp)
- nsubjpass and csubjpass in se-passives were annotated
- cop relation direction was corrected
- the relation between nouns and short possessive pronouns was re-annotated from case to det

We also have changed the feature VerbForm=Fin to VerbForm=Part for participles.


The rest of the sentences will be converted for the next release.

SPLIT DATA DESCRIPTION
======================

The files of the original treebank were concatenated in one file. Then:

- each tenth sentence was selected for the development set
- each first sentence was selected for the test part
- the rest sentences are in the training set

Remark: Each tenth sentence means the following: when the ID of the sentence
is divided by 10, the reminder is 0.
Each first sentence means the following: when the ID of the sentence is
divided by 10, the reminder is 1.

STATISTICS
==========
Number of Sentences: 11 138
Number of Tokens: 156 323

The original treebank was developed in a project (2001-2004), funded by the
Volkswagen Stiftung, Federal Republic of Germany under the Programme
"Cooperation with Natural and Engineering Scientists in Central and Eastern
Europe". The project was carried out mainly at IICT-BAS in tight cooperation
with researchers at the Seminar für Sprachwissenschaft (SfS),
Eberhard-Karls-Universität, Tübingen, Germany. Link:
